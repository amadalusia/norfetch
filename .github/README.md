### installing on nix

add this repo as an input in your flake.nix:

```nix
inputs = {
  norfetch = {
    url = "github:balkenix/norfetch";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };
};
```

and add the package:

```nix
# home.nix

home.packages = [
  inputs.norfetch.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
];
```
